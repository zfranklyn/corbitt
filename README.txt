Corbett Prep Data Collection System






Product Requirements DocumentIntroduction & Goal
Traditional anonymous surveys are sent using bulk emails, without much consideration towards respondents’ user experience. The Corbett System aims to be a better and easier way to anonymously distribute, track, and complete surveys. Tracking should be automatic, and survey distribution and reminders are done through text messaging to be direct, noticeable, and personalized.

Who’s it for?
Teachers
Ms. Taylor loves her job, but is very busy and a bit overworked. Her life and work are quite separate; when she’s home, she’s not thinking about work. Ms. Taylor has a well established routine of checking her email in the morning, but has hundreds of emails to read, and sometimes misses things. She supports the various initiatives launched by the school, and tries her best to complete surveys when received, but is annoyed when they are too long or inconvenient.

Mr. Johnson is a very dedicated and experienced teacher. He has been teaching for 30 years, and is wary of these new ‘initiatives’ brought by the administration every few months, because they usually end up fizzling out. He reads every email and complete surveys as needed, but does so reluctantly when he believes them to be superfluous or inconvenient.

Mr. Bingham is a very experienced teacher, but is not very technologically savvy, and will often miss emails or not know how to use things unless the instructions are very clear.

Things to note:
Email reminders are fallible. A survey link can easily be lost in the mountain of emails, either put off till later (and forgotten) or not seen at all.
Teachers may not check their emails after a certain point during the day
Teachers are busy, and need to be reminded - but not overly so, lest they get annoyed

Researchers
These users will be distributing surveys and analyzing data.

Why build it?
It’s a much more effective and convenient way for respondents to receive surveys and reminders.
Makes it easy to track and remind users without compromising anonymity.
Makes it possible to conduct daily experience sampling.
It’s the right time: an existing customer (Corbett Prep) is willing to use this system. The prototype 1.0 from last semester was very well received.
Potential to scale to other schools and communities where data collection is needed.


What is it?
Essentially a scheduled messaging system, customized to track user behavior and send scheduled reminders through email and text message.

Send surveys: via text or email
Send reminders: via text
Send messages & information
Check on status: know how many people completed, how many late etc.
Scheduling: define when you want surveys and reminders to automatically send
Receive feedback

Send Surveys
Researchers should be able to create and save different message templates, and be able to send them out via email or text.

Send Reminders
Once a survey has been sent, researchers should be able to send reminders (based on templates) to users who have not yet completed surveys.

Send Messages & Information
Researchers should be able to send general information via this system. Respondents should receive automatic messages when they complete the survey.

Check on Status
Researchers should be able to check how many people have completed the survey, and whether they want to send a manual reminder

Scheduling
All messages should be able to be sent automatically according to a researcher-defined schedule.

Receive Feedback
The system should be able to receive feedback from respondents about the system, or answer any technical questions that they may have about the system.
